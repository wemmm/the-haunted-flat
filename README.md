## What is it now Jenny?

This is a text-based adventure game that uses [TheBroox's](https://github.com/TheBroox) [Text Adventure](https://github.com/TheBroox/TextAdventure.js) engine.

The Haunted Flat refers to chapter seven of [The Master and Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita) by [Mikhail Bulgakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov), which I am trying to adapt into a text adventure format because that's what I feel like doing apparently. It's a really good book but this specific chapter is a decently enclosed 'scene' and I think it's probably best to start small. It's also geographically easy to grasp - as you might be able to tell from the title, it's (almost) all set inside a flat.

## How does it work?

Clone this repo and:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then in the text box you'll see in your browser:
```
load haunted_flat
```

You are Stepa Likhodeyev, manager of the Variety Theatre, and you are just waking up from a terrible hangover. The flat you share on Sadovaya Street, Moscow, has a curious reputation: its occupants tend to inexplicably vanish. You really ought to get out of bed, although first you should probably put on some trousers. 

## Tech:

* Node
* Express
* Javascript
* npm text-adventure
